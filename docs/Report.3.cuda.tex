\section{Introduction}

This is part of advancedhpc2022 course. We try to implement algorithm to convert rgb image to gray-scale image. It is just simple algorithm. But we implement it in 2 methods: first to run on cpu and second to run on gpu. Then we try to measure and compare elapsed time between 2 methods.

\section{CPU Implementation}

Do it simple with a loop and recompute each pixel. Following
below instruction:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Load image
\item Flatten image
\item Loop and build average value for each pixel
\item Re-shape image to original shape
\item Shape image to new file
\end{enumerate}

Evaluation:

# TODO: coming soon
